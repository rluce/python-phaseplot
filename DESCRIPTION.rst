Phase portraits for complex funcions
====================================

A set of functions to generate phase portraits (or phase plots) of functions
mapping from the complex plane onto itself.  Such portraits are a convenient
tool for visualizing such complex functions; see Wegert (2012) [TODO].
This package is based on matplotlib [link, TODO].
